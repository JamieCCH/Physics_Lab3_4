[Game3002]Physics Engines Lab3&amp;4

This lab will demonstrate your understanding of projectile physics.

It will contain a football, which will act as the projectile.  A field goal post somewhere off in the distance, you can choose how many meters, the min amount is 20m.  The game mechanics will behave like in the video posted below.  

The user can adjust the horizontal and vertical trajectory, they are represented by arrows that rotate on the x and y axis.  a 90 degree angle on the x axis would mean the ball is going straight up in the air. 

Place limits on the rotation the user can select, nothing more than 90 degrees.

when the player presses space the angles are locked and a power gauge comes up, the player will press space again to determine the strength of the kick.  You will have a max and min initial velocity, full bar on the gauge will give the player the max initial velocity, zero bar on the gauge will give the player min velocity, so the projective move a little at least.  

Like the video below, you must display where the ball is going to land while the player is adjusting the horizontal and vertical rotations.  display the projected landing position based on max level on the power gauge, aka max velocity. 

At the end of the "kick" the user can either try again or quit.

Projected Landing (5%)
    -3.5% for landing position
    -1.5% for an arc, or segments, something representing travel path.

Power Gauge (2%)

Successful FG detection/ui/player feedback (3%)
